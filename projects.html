<div class="h"><h1 id="endless-projects">Endless Projects</h1><a aria-hidden="true" href="#endless-projects">[link]</a></div>
<p>These projects don‚Äôt have some end-goal, so I will continue to add
ontop of them for as-long as I find it either useful or enjoyable</p>
<h2 id="basil-overlay"><a
href="https://codeberg.org/BasilBasil/basil-overlay">Basil
Overlay</a></h2>
<p>I have a Gentoo overlay I‚Äôm working on, the main purpose of it is to
package my own software, software that either isn‚Äôt packaged anywhere
else, and software that is packaged poorly/missing features in other
overlays.</p>
<h2 id="etools"><a
href="https://codeberg.org/BasilBasil/etools">Etools</a></h2>
<p>Etools is another Gentoo-centric project I‚Äôve been working on, It‚Äôs a
bash script that contains a bunch of small applets (kind of like how
busybox works) meant to speed up a lot of tasks on Gentoo.</p>
<p>It can help with things such as enabling repositories, listing which
package a specific use flag is enabled on, precalculating dependencies
for solving update conflicts, providing the time since your last emerge
sync in a customizable format, and finding out what cpu flags are
enabled by gcc when using <code>-march=native</code> so that you can
migrate to a distcc setup while keeping all your CPU optimizations
enabled.</p>
<h2 id="util-basil"><a
href="https://codeberg.org/BasilBasil/util-basil">util-basil</a></h2>
<p>util-basil started off as a few standalone utilities that I was
writing with the intention of speeding up very small tasks like getting
the difference between two dates, counting down, and moving a file to
~/.local/bin/ and marking it as executable.</p>
<p>Nothing in util-basil is anything remarkable, <del>honestly some of
the code in there is pretty embarassing</del> but it‚Äôs just a bunch of
stuff I designed to be good enough to get the job done.</p>
<p>Some of the tools in util-basil are required for some of my other
programs to work to avoid rewriting the same code multiple times.</p>
<h2 id="nyaofetch"><a
href="https://codeberg.org/BasilBasil/nyaofetch">nyaofetch</a></h2>
<p>Nyaofetch is a project I created for fun, it utilizes one of my
already-complete projects called boltauthd, the goal of nyaofetch is to
have a more featureful UI with the ability to distinguish dGPUs and
eGPUs and allow listing a specific GPU using a index in an array.</p>
<p>Most importantly I wanted to implement it such that none of these
features made it slower than neofetch so I try to cache information
where possible and use more performant ways of fetching information.</p>
<div class="h"><h1 id="active-projects">Active Projects</h1><a aria-hidden="true" href="#active-projects">[link]</a></div>
<p>Here‚Äôs a list of my ongoing projects!</p>
<h2 id="eplug"><a
href="https://codeberg.org/BasilBasil/eplug">eplug</a></h2>
<p>eplug is a project I started after migrating to using Gentoo Linux
alongside Bedrock Linux, the goal of the project is to allow the easy
addition of custom configuration directories in the portage
configuration directory.</p>
<p>Initially the project was called ehook and just added a directory for
defining package hooks for any ebuild phase, but after migrating to
bedrock and attempting to make global configurations with it I realized
the limitations that the current structure imposed.</p>
<p>So instead of simply changing the configuration structure again I
decided to write a plugin manager so I could avoid rewriting large
amounts of the same code for each custom portage bashrc hook.</p>
<p>This project is still in early development but it‚Äôs one of my
favorites to work on at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="charon"><a
href="https://codeberg.org/BasilBasil/Charon">Charon</a></h2>
<p>Charon is a project I started a while back, originally with the goal
to create a small tool for switching between graphics cards for Vulkan
and and OpenGL programs, it quickly expanded because I had to test that
it was working and realized that checking the current GPU for multiple
APIs at once was annoying.</p>
<p>So I set out to create a neat user interface for viewing the GPU that
is in use for every major graphics API.</p>
<p>Now the toolset is comprised on 3 parts: one for listing connected
GPUs and GPU kernel modules (asphodel), one for setting the GPU
(elysium), and one for displaying what GPU is in use (tartarus).</p>
<h2 id="sudoas"><a
href="https://codeberg.org/BasilBasil/sudoas">sudoas</a></h2>
<p>Sudoas is a project I‚Äôm working on on-and-off, it serves as a wrapper
for doas to mimick the existence of sudo, with the end-goal of being 1:1
compatible with sudo command line flags (and perhaps even others in the
future).</p>
<div class="h"><h2 id="idlebox">idlebox</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#idlebox">[link]</a></div>
<p>Idlebox is one of the larger projects I‚Äôm currently working on, the
goal is to recreate all of the GNU Coreutils using pure POSIX shell with
no external dependencies. (Yes, this includes recreating a bash
environment)</p>
<p>I haven‚Äôt yet gotten the project to a state that I‚Äôm happy with, but
I plan to share it once it gets to that point!</p>
<div class="h"><h2 id="container-manager-name-tbd">container manager (name TBD)</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#container-manager-name-tbd">[link]</a></div>
<p>This project is currently undergoing a full rewrite, the goal of the
program is to make it easy to quickly deploy a container install of any
distro with your own customizations, simmilar to how docker works but
compatible with multiple tools such as chroot, proot, unshare,
newuidmap, newgidmap, and possibly others to make it hopefully as
portable as possible.</p>
<p>My hopes are to get it running out of the box on most linux distros
both with and without root access.</p>
<p>When the rewrite of the project is done and I‚Äôm happy with the level
of modularity is has then I‚Äôll be sharing this one on codeberg aswell!
<sup>-</sup></p>
<div class="h"><h1 id="finished-projects">Finished Projects</h1><a aria-hidden="true" href="#finished-projects">[link]</a></div>
<p>These are projects that already reached feature-completion.</p>
<h2 id="boltauthd"><a
href="https://codeberg.org/BasilBasil/boltauthd">boltauthd</a></h2>
<p>Boltauthd is a project that I originally created for use with
Nyaofetch, with the purpose of tracking when PCIe devices are plugged in
to compare them to a list that was cached when the system booted up so
that it can correlate a ThunderBolt/USB4 device ID to the PCI ID.</p>
<p>The purpose of distinguishing them was to be able to figure out which
PCI display adapters are external and which ones are internal so that I
could store external GPUs in a separate array index from internal GPUs
to improve the customization of Nyaofetch‚Äôs output.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm really happy with how it turned out in the end, it was certainly
a bit janky in the methodology but the results are very consistent even
when rapidly hotplugging devices.</p>

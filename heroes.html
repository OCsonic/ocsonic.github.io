<p>This page is dedicated to listing off people that I look up to.</p>
<p>Reasons that someone can end up on this list may vary greatly, but
generally people that are here have done something that has lasting
impacts in helping people.</p>
<p>(Most if not all of the people listed here are LGBTQ+ people. If you
take issue with that then, Womp Womp.)</p>
<div class="h"><h1 id="leah-rowe">Leah Rowe</h1><a aria-hidden="true" href="#leah-rowe">[link]</a></div>
<p>Without Leah Rowe this site literally wouldn’t exist! (They literally
wrote the program I use to generate the site!)</p>
<div class="h"><h2 id="reasons-why-theyre-awesome">Reasons why they’re awesome</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#reasons-why-theyre-awesome">[link]</a></div>
<ul>
<li>Founder and lead maintainer of Libreboot</li>
<li>Caused the FSF to send a <a
href="https://libreboot.org/news/gnuboot.html#gnu-boot-cease-and-desist-email">hypocritical
cease and desist</a></li>
<li>Responded to the GNU Boot cease and desist by creating a
in-every-way <a href="https://canoeboot.org/">superior version</a> that
continues to recieve updates</li>
<li>Develops the <a href="https://untitled.vimuser.org/">Untitled Static
Site Generator</a> which makes this site possible</li>
<li><a href="https://vimuser.org/nonbinary.html">Non-binary software
developer icon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall Leah Rowe is someone who inspires me a lot by how they have
refused to allow other people to walk over them and even went as far as
to entirely nullify the purpose of GNU Boot</p>
<div class="h"><h1 id="alan-turing">Alan Turing</h1><a aria-hidden="true" href="#alan-turing">[link]</a></div>
<p>Alan Turing was a codebreaker during the Second World War who was
responsible for drastically shortening the war and also creating the
documents behind the first stored-program computer.</p>
<div class="h"><h2 id="reasons-why-hes-awesome">Reasons why he’s awesome</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#reasons-why-hes-awesome">[link]</a></div>
<ul>
<li>Created the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Computing_Engine">first
detailed design</a> of a stored-program computer</li>
<li>Shortened World War 2 by possibly over two years with his <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis
work</a>!</li>
<li><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Government_apology_and_pardon">Gay
STEM icon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The lasting impact from Alan Turing’s work is still being felt to
this day in numerous ways including the (informally) <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_law">Alan Turing law</a>
from 2017 which retroactively pardoned men who were imprisoned in the
United Kingdom for “homosexual acts”. Had Alan Turing not been around,
then likely no prescendent would have been set and there would be many
people in the UK who would still have their records stained in the eyes
on the UK law for simply being gay. Though the people who were sentenced
to death can’t have those sentences revoked, it’s still a tremendous
step in the right direction to have the government acknowledge their own
past faults and try to ammend it in some sense.</p>

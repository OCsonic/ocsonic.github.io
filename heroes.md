Opening
=======
This page is dedicated to listing off people that I look up to.

Reasons that someone can end up on this list may vary greatly, but generally people that are here have done something that has lasting impacts in helping people.

(Most if not all of the people listed here are LGBTQ+ people. If you take issue with that then, Womp Womp.)

Leah Rowe
=========
Without Leah Rowe this site literally wouldn't exist! (They literally wrote the program I use to generate the site!)

Reasons why they're awesome
---------------------------
- Founder and lead maintainer of Libreboot
- Caused the FSF to send a [hypocritical cease and desist](https://libreboot.org/news/gnuboot.html#gnu-boot-cease-and-desist-email) 
- Responded to the GNU Boot cease and desist by creating a in-every-way [superior version](https://canoeboot.org/) that continues to recieve updates
- Develops the [Untitled Static Site Generator](https://untitled.vimuser.org/) which makes this site possible
- [Non-binary software developer icon](https://vimuser.org/nonbinary.html)

Overall Leah Rowe is someone who inspires me a lot by how they have refused to allow other people to walk over them and even went as far as to entirely nullify the purpose of GNU Boot 

Alan Turing
===========
Alan Turing was a codebreaker during the Second World War who was responsible for drastically shortening the war and also creating the documents behind the first stored-program computer.

Reasons why he's awesome
------------------------
- Created the [first detailed design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Computing_Engine) of a stored-program computer
- Shortened World War 2 by possibly over two years with his [cryptanalysis work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Cryptanalysis)!
- [Gay STEM icon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Government_apology_and_pardon)

The lasting impact from Alan Turing's work is still being felt to this day in numerous ways including the (informally) [Alan Turing law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing_law) from 2017 which retroactively pardoned men who were imprisoned in the United Kingdom for "homosexual acts". Had Alan Turing not been around, then likely no prescendent would have been set and there would be many people in the UK who would still have their records stained in the eyes on the UK law for simply being gay. Though the people who were sentenced to death can't have those sentences revoked, it's still a tremendous step in the right direction to have the government acknowledge their own past faults and try to ammend it in some sense.
